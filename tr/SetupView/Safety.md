# Safety Setup

The *Safety Setup* page allows you to configure the most important failsafe settings (other failsafe settings can be set via the [parameters](../SetupView/Parameters.md) described in the failsafe documentation for each vehicle type).

For ArduPilot safety page information see: [Safety (ArduPilot)](../SetupView/safety_ardupilot.md)

The PX4 page is shown below.

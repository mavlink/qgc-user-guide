# Virtual Joystick

*QGroundControl* allows you to control a vehicle with on-screen virtual thumbsticks. These are displayed as shown below in the flight view.

> **Note** Thumbstick control is not as responsive as using an RC Transmitter (because the information is sent over MAVLink). Another alternative is to use a [USB Joystick/Gamepad](../SetupView/Joystick.md).


## Enable the thumbsticks

To enable the virtual joysticks:

1. Select the **Q** icon (*Application Settings*) from the top toolbar and then **General** from the sidebar.
1. Select the **Virtual joystick** checkbox

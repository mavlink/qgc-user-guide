## RTK GPS

This section specifies the RTK GPS "Survey-in" settings.

![RTK GPS Settings](../../assets/settings/settings_view_general_rtk_gps.jpg)

> **Note** The *Survey-In* process is a startup procedure required by RTK GPS systems to get an accurate estimate of the base station position. The process takes measurements over time, leading to increasing position accuracy. Both of the setting conditions must met for the Survey-in process to complete. For more information see [RTK GPS](https://docs.px4.io/en/advanced_features/rtk-gps.html) (PX4 docs) and [GPS- How it works](http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-gps-how-it-works.html#rtk-corrections) (ArduPilot docs).

The settings are:
- **Survey-in accuracy:** The minimum position accuracy for the RTK Survey-in process to complete.
- **Minimum observation duration:** The minimum time that will be taken for the RTK Survey-in process. 


## AutoConnect to the following devices {#auto_connect}

This section defines the set of devices to which *QGroundControl* will auto-connect. 

![Device autoconnect settings](../../assets/settings/settings_view_general_autoconnect_devices.jpg)

Settings include:
- **Pixhawk**: Autoconnect to Pixhawk-series device
- **SiK Radio**:  Autoconnect to SiK (Telemetry) radio
- **PX4 Flow**: Autoconnect to PX4Flow device
- **Libre Pilot**: Autoconnect to Libre Pilot autopilot
- **UDP**: Autoconnect to UDP
- **RTK GPS**: Autoconnect to RTK GPS device
- **NMEA GPS Device / Baudrate**: If detected, GPS information will be used for ground station location and follow me support.

## Video {#video}

The *Video* section is used to define the source and connection settings for video that will be displayed in *Fly View*.

![Video settings](../../assets/settings/settings_view_general_video_udp.jpg)

  If no video source is specified then no other video or *video recording* settings will be displayed (above we see the settings when UDP source is selected).


## Video Recording

The *Video Recording* section is used to specify the file format and maximum allocated file storage for storing video. 
Videos are saved to a sub-directory ("Video") of the [Application Load/Save Path](#load_save_path).

![Video - without auto deletion](../../assets/settings/settings_view_general_video_recording.jpg)

## Brand Image

This setting specifies the *brand image* used for indoor/outdoor colour schemes.

The brand image is displayed in place of the icon for the connected autopilot in the top right corner of the toolbar.

#### Sync
The Sync tools allows you to move Rally Points back and forth to your Vehicle or a file. *Before you fly you must be sure to send your Rally Points to your vehicle.* The tool will change to have an "!" within it to indicate that you have changes to your GeoFence which you have not sent to your vehicle. 

The Sync tool provides the following functionality:

* Send to Vehicle
* Load from Vehicle
* Save to File
* Load from File

#### Remaining tools
The rest of the tools work exactly as they do while editing a Mission.

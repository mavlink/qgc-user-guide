# Daily Build Major Changes

This topic contains a high level and *non-exhaustive* list of new features added to *QGroundControl* since the last [stable release](../releases/release_notes.md). These features are available in [daily builds](../releases/daily_builds.md).

* [Structure Scan V2](../PlanView/pattern_structure_scan_v2.md) - The previous *Structure Scan* code had major issues.
  This new version addresses those problems and includes new features.

## Installing iOS Beta using Test Flight

The iOS version of *QGroundControl* is currently in open Beta. You can opt-in to the Beta by adding your email address [here](https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol/issues/3509). 

Keep in mind that due to device restrictions on iOS only WiFi connections are supported. Once installed you will be notified of new versions through the Test Flight app. The release frequency of iOS beta builds is on an ad-hoc basis more on the order of a new build every week or two.

## Android daily builds

Daily builds for Android have their own [Google Play store entry here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mavlink.qgroundcontrolbeta&rdid=org.mavlink.qgroundcontrolbeta) (as linked above). 

> **Note** The old opt-in beta test is no longer valid. If you were a member of that you should [opt-out](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.mavlink.qgroundcontrol).

# 다운로드 및 설치

아래 섹션에서 여러 플랫폼의 *QGroundControl* [최신 안정 배포판](../releases/release_notes.md)를 다운로드할 수 있습니다.

> **Tip** 설치 후 *QGroundControl*이 정상적으로 실행되지 않으면 [QGC 설정 문제 해결](../troubleshooting/qgc_setup.md)편을 참조하십시오!

## 시스템 요구 사항

QGC should run well on any modern computer or mobile device. Performance will depend on the system environment, 3rd party applications, and available system resources. More capable hardware will provide a better experience. A computer with at least 8Gb RAM, an SSD, Nvidia or AMD graphics and an i5 or better CPU will be suitable for most applications.

For the best experience and compatibility, we recommend you the newest version of your operating system.

## Windows {#windows}

*QGroundControl* can be installed on 64 bit versions of Windows:

1. Download [QGroundControl-installer.exe](https://d176tv9ibo4jno.cloudfront.net/latest/QGroundControl-installer.exe).
2. Double click the executable to launch the installer.

> **Note** The Windows installer creates 3 shortcuts: **QGroundControl**, **GPU Compatibility Mode**, **GPU Safe Mode**. Use the first shortcut unless you experience startup or video rendering issues. For more information see [Troubleshooting QGC Setup > Windows: UI Rendering/Video Driver Issues](../troubleshooting/qgc_setup.md#opengl_troubleshooting).

## Ubuntu Linux {#ubuntu}

*QGroundControl* can be installed/run on Ubuntu LTS 20.04 (and later).

Ubuntu comes with a serial modem manager that interferes with any robotics related use of a serial port (or USB serial). Before installing *QGroundControl* you should remove the modem manager and grant yourself permissions to access the serial port. You also need to install *GStreamer* in order to support video streaming.

Before installing *QGroundControl* for the first time:

1. On the command prompt enter:
    
    ```sh
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
    sudo apt-get remove modemmanager -y
    sudo apt install gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-gl -y
    sudo apt install libqt5gui5 -y
    ```
    
    <!-- Note, remove install of libqt5gui5 https://github.com/mavlink/qgroundcontrol/issues/10176 fixed -->

2. Logout and login again to enable the change to user permissions.

&nbsp; To install *QGroundControl*:

1. Download [QGroundControl.AppImage](https://d176tv9ibo4jno.cloudfront.net/latest/QGroundControl.AppImage).
2. Install (and run) using the terminal commands: 
        sh
        chmod +x ./QGroundControl.AppImage
        ./QGroundControl.AppImage  (or double click)
